    "Q1. Explain the concept of precision and recall in the context of classification models\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Precision is the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions, while recall is the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances. "

    "Q2. What is the F1 score and how is it calculated? How is it different from precision and recall?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, giving equal weight to both. It is calculated as 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall). It balances both precision and recall, while they focus on different aspects individually."

    "\n",
    "Answer: ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) is a curve showing the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate. AUC (Area Under the Curve) measures the overall performance of the classifier, where a higher AUC indicates better classification performance."
